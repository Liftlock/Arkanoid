Arkanoid - Taito 1986 



Bricks
------
There are three different kinds of bricks: colored bricks, silver bricks, and gold bricks. 
Bricks of different colors make up the majority of the walls in each area. 
They only require one hit to defeat, but they vary in point value from one another.

White   - 50 points	
Orange  - 60 points
Cyan    - 70 points
Green   - 80 points
Red     - 90 points
Blue    - 100 points
Violet  - 110 points
Yellow  - 120 points

Silver bricks take more than one hit to destroy. 
In the beginning, they only require two hits to destroy.
The number of hits it takes to remove them increases by one every eight stages. 
Silver  - 50 points * Round number 

Gold bricks are indestructable and aren't removed from the level 
Gold    - 0 points 











The game of Arkanoid is divided into 33 stages. 
The first 32 stages are composed of a variety of layouts of bricks. 
The final 33rd stage is a confrontation between the Vaus and the physical manifestation of 
the enemy known only as "DOH" who resembles a large head of a Moai statue from Easter Island. 

After successfully clearing 32 stages, you will have the opportunity to use your remaining lives to defeat the enemy DOH. 
If you do not succeed in defeating DOH before the game is over, you will not be permitted to continue and try again. 
You must hit DOH with the ball 16 times. As you try, DOH spits projectiles from his mouth that are deadly to the Vaus. 
If one of them strikes the Vaus, it will explode, so they must be avoided at all costs while preventing the ball from ever slipping 
below the Vaus. If you succeed, you will be presented with the ending to the game.
